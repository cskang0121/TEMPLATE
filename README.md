# Project Description

After learning the course "Getting Started with Git and GitHub" by IBM, I am equipped with the knowledge and skills to work with GitHub UI and Git CLI. I have acquired the skills to create an open source project in Git, make changes to that project and make it available to the community. For this project, I created a GitHub repository, clone that repository to my local system, make changes to the local repository, commit the changes locally, push it back to my GitHub, and create a pull request to add my update. 

This mini project is for me to get familiarise with Git CLI, Git UI as well as Git conventions. This is done by experimenting with Git and a mini project â€“ A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

Input:
   - p, principal amount
   - t, time period in years
   - r, annual rate of interest
   
Output:
   - simple interest = p*t*r

This is the final project from the following course :
